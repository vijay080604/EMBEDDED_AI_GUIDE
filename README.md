# EMBEDDED_AI_GUIDE
# 🤖 Embedded AI

Welcome to the **Embedded AI** repository — a personal initiative to explore the exciting intersection of **Embedded Systems** and **Artificial Intelligence**.

This repository is a structured log of my journey, experiments, and learnings as I dive deeper into **Embedded AI**, where resource-constrained devices meet the power of intelligent decision-making.

> ⚡ *This README and content structure were thoughtfully drafted with the assistance of **ChatGPT**, an AI developed by OpenAI, as part of my effort to maintain clarity, consistency, and professionalism.*
